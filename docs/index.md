# Overview

## OPBNOS API

Aviz OPBNOS is SONiC-based Packet Broker provides a highly scalable, flexible, and affordable solution to capture, aggregate, and analyze traffic and feed the data to any tool, including legacy FPGA appliances. As a virtualized aggregator it can be deployed on any white-box ASIC, eliminating the dependency on proprietary appliances all together. It leverages the modern programmable ASICs and enables you to easily scale up or down to meet the ever changing needs from network visibility and security tools, empowering you to manage demand with maximum efficiency. All this fleet-wide data is provided to the network administrators using standardized OPBNOS APIs.

* Aviz OPBNOS API provides a Python-based SDK for communication with Aviz OPBNOS over HTTP/HTTPS transport.
* The Python based APIs allows network administrators and developers to automate network configuration tasks and operational workflows on OPBNOS devices via a singular interface. 
* It can be utilized by network administrators to fetch real-time data and telemetry information as well as implement bulk configuration changes across multiple OPBNOS devices.
